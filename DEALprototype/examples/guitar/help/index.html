					<h3>About Guitar Scale Assistant (v 1.2)</h3>
					<img src="gfx/spacer.jpg"><br>
					<br>
					Guitar Scale Assistant is a free open source java based guitar scale 
					application available under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU 
						General Public Liscense</a> (GPL). The primary purpose of this application 
					is to provide assistance to guitarists of all levels for quickly finding scales 
					and modes through pattern searches. Some of the main features available in GSA 
					allow you to:<br>
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li>
						Find matching scales by chords or note progressions
						<li>
						Search scales by name
						<li>
						Create and save new scales
						<li>
						View scales in alternate tunings
						<li>
							Listen to scales individually or over chords</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					GSA currently comes with over 600 scales, but the list is constantly growing. 
					Check for updates to get new scales or easily create and store your own for 
					reference. There are many new features planned for future releases. If there 
					are any additional features you'd like to see for future versions of this 
					project, or if you would like to help contribute to the application, please 
					visit the <a href="http://guitarsa.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> page. 
					Thanks for checking out Guitar Scale Assistant!
