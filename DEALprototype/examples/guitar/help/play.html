					<b>Fig. 7</b> Selecting chords
					<br>
					<br>
					By clicking the "Select notes for chord" button (shown above), you enter a note 
					selection mode. While in this mode, the pointer cursor will be replaced by a 
					hand cursor. You can then continue to select notes on the clickable fretboard 
					by left-clicking on notes, which will highlight the notes in red. You can 
					de-select notes by right-clicking on them. The selected notes will represent 
					what chord you want to hear when you play the scale and chord together. <i>(Note: a 
						chord will be played by itself if no scale is selected or the bottom display 
						fretboard is cleared).</i>

					<br>
					You can control the tempo and volume of the player by clicking and dragging the 
					tempo/ volume knobs to the left or right. To play a scale by itself, pick the 
					scale you want to hear using the methods outlined in the "Viewing Scales" 
					section, and click the "Play scale only" button shown above. The scale will be 
					played once through from the lowest note to the highest note on the display 
					fretboard. To play a scale and chord together, click the "Play scale and chord 
					together" button. The selected scale will be played along with the chord 
					highlighted on the clickable fretboard (played every 4th note).
					<br>
					<br>
					You can select to hear the scales and chords through an acoustic guitar, jazz 
					guitar, or distorted electric guitar by clicking the different guitar icons in 
					the lower left portion of the window.
