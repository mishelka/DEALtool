This is the INSTALLING-GUIDE for the Rapla-BINARY-DISTRIBUTION, 

You will find more information on our documentation pages on
http://rapla.sourceforge.net/documentation.html

if you have downloaded the SOURCE-DISTRIBUTION you have to
!!! BUILD A BINARY-DISTRIBUTION first !!!
For more information read README-BUILD.txt.

Requirements:

You need JAVA: JRE 1.5 at least (1.6 recommended). 
You can download it from java.sun.com

* The SDK works for the binary and source distribution but is very
  large (>20 MB)

* The JRE will only work for the binary distribution (Compiler
  missing) but is much smaller (12MB)


STARTING RAPLA:

Start rapla.exe (rapla.sh under Unix).

To start Rapla from the command-line, you have to set the java command
in your PATH-Variable (if its not already there),

Example:
setenv PATH $PATH:/usr/local/java/bin  (Unix)
set PATH=%PATH%:c:\Programme\Java\jre\bin  (Windows) 

Then type:

rapla.sh (Unix) 
rapla.bat (XP/7). 
call rapla.bat (win NT/2000)


If you want to try out the simpsons-sample change the 
following configuration entry in webapp/WEB-INF/rapla.xconf

  <file-storage id="file" logger="file-operator">
    <file>simpsons-data.xml</file>
    <validate>no</validate>
  </file-storage>

or overwrite your existing data.xml file.

If you want to test multiuser functionality comment out the default login-entry in the facade-entry:
<!-- We comment out the username and the password to disable automatic login
    <username>admin</username>
    <password></password>
-->

You can than use the following logins:

isa 	lisa 	 	
admin 	donut 		
homer 	duffs 	(Admin)	
skinner 	edna 		
monty 	money 	(Admin)	
abe 	matlock
